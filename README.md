Spectron Example
=====================

This is a POC to use spectron in a electron v12 app

How it works
-----

After cloning this repo, navigate to the .env file and change the APP_PATH to the app location example: `APP_PATH=/Applications/DemoFlow.app/Contents/MacOS/DemoFlow`, to run the test:

    npm install
    npm run test

To run this locally you have to use Node.js 13 and above.
